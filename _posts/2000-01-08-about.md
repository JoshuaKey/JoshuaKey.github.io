<div class="collapse" id="lifeStory" markdown="1">
I grew up in Davison, Michigan. I was never quite sure what I was going to be when I grew up. I had a lot of ideas like a veterinarian, technician, mathematician, etc. I took a lot of classes to see what I liked. 

Turns out it was Programming!

I took AP Computer Science in high school and made my first game, Sudoku. The code was crap and it wasn't too visually appealing. But it put me on track.

I went to Neumont College of Computer Science in Salt Lake City. It was advertised quite well having 97% of graduates with a job after 6 months, Only 3 years to graduate, and filled with gamers and geeks.

When I started, I wasn't actually sure what I'd be majoring in. I though about CS as a good balance between the degrees or maybe Web Dev for visuals. I wasn't too keen on going Game Dev because I knew it was a difficult field. In addition, everyone told me Game Dev was the hardest degree. Over time, I realized that I actually enjoyed making games and I enjoyed the challenge. I decided it was a win-win.

Quickly after I joined the degree, the Degree Chair quit. Not sure why. He was replaced by my current Degree Chair, Professor Maple. Professor Maple changed the degree quite drastically. It was no longer, "the hardest degree" and it started teaching how to genuinely make games. Before we had been focusing on Engines and Graphics mainly. Some students didn't like the degree because they enjoyed the challenge, but I was glad I was actually learning how to make games. That's why I chose the Game Degree.

Time went on. I learned a lot, Made more games and Capstone came up. Capstone is this senior solo project that showcases your abilities, knowledge and talent. I made an Unity Plugin called [Easy Marketing in Unity](https://github.com/JoshuaKey/EasyMarketingInUnity). It allowed developers to take pictures of their game and post them on Social Media from within the Editor. I like the project and what it taught me, but I wouldn't really call it a success. Lot of Bugs and Issues, not all mine.

More time went by and I had Enterprise, basically a group oriented Internship / Externship to other companies. My first Enterprise isn't really notable. My second Enterprise lead me to develop Pot Smash (Temporary Name)

Pot Smash is sponsored by Neumont themself. They take several game students and give them the freedom to make a (hopefully) impressive game in 10 weeks. Currently the game is almost half-way in progress and we've come a long way. Its looking nice and I think it'll be a game I'm proud of.

Thanks for reading! I'll update my life story as events unfold and let you know what happens.
