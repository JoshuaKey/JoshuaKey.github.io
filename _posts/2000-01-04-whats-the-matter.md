Collect atoms, Build objects, Sell them!

Split the atom or Smash them together!

Fill in the Periodic Table and Create new elements.

Can you make a trillion dollars using just atoms?

What's the Matter is an semi-Educational, semi-Idle Collector, semi-Simulation game. Collect, Split and Combine atoms starting with Hydrogen all the way to Ognasseon. Create elements that have never been created before.  Upgrade the Atom Collector for even more atoms. Craft items with your atoms and sell them to make a living.

Doctor Scientist is smart, but not the brightest guy. Help him fix his $1,000,000,000 debt by collecting atoms, one atom at a time.
