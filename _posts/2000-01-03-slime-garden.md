## Slime Garden

Slime Garden is a mix of metroidvania and rpg. 

Like a metroidvania, you will explore and unlock new areas.

Like an rpg you will fight enemies and earn levels.

The difference is that you unlock new areas from rpg elements, like quests!

Use A and D to move Left and Right. 

Use W to climb.

Use S to fall.

Use Space to attack.

Enjoy!
